## ProjectNola

Web site: [http://www.projectnola.com](http://www.projectnola.com)

> "Please check with ProjectNola. They are doing a great job in helping to fight crime using their video network and radio scanners and communication with police. I am not aware of a specific software project they may have but would like to throw them whatever assistance is possible to help reduce crime and prosecute offenders."

## Operation Spark

Web site: [http://operationspark.org](http://operationspark.org)

Contact: [John Fabroni](https://twitter.com/OperationSpark)

> "John Fabroni... is running what is basically Cafe Reconcile for web development. He's running a bootcamp out of 4.0 Schools right now teaching underprivileged kids how to code and it's going really well. This is an awesome program that I'd love to see more people get involved in."

## Lakeview Civic

Web site: [http://www.lakeviewcivic.org](http://www.lakeviewcivic.org)

Contact: [Ralph Schindler](mailto:ralph.schindler@lakeviewcivic.org)

Aside from maintaining and updating the main web site and its membership directory, Ralph also has ideas for a social application to facilitate communication between neighbors at various geographical levels and between governmental representatives and their constituents.

## Techarrette

Web site: [http://nola.gov/techarrette/](http://nola.gov/techarrette/)

> "Techarrettes are creative, intensive, collaborative, iterative design efforts that uses a series of carefully tailored inputs and questions to examine a single challenge from a variety of perspectives and scales. The goal of a Techarrette is to conduct highly rich planning and/or generate new ideas. This techarrette will address software design considerations for a generalizable, low-cost, scalable web-based tool for crowdsourcing the scoring of property conditions from a centrally collected photographic dataset."

## Central City Little Free Library Project

Web site: [https://www.facebook.com/CentralCityLFL](https://www.facebook.com/CentralCityLFL)

Contact: [Greg Cartwright](https://www.facebook.com/greg.cartwright.5)

At the moment, Greg has his hands full with the project and has declined help with additional related endeavors. However, at some point in the future, they could implement a web/mobile solution for operations common to normal libraries: listing "branches," available books, etc.

## Code for America

Web site: [http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/](http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/)

New Orleans doesnâ€™t appear to have a brigade. Perhaps we should see about forming one.

## The Vault

Web site: [http://thelensnola.org/TheVault/](http://thelensnola.org/TheVault/)

Contact: [Abe Handler](https://www.facebook.com/abe.handler)

## Teacher Wish List App

This idea originated in Lafayette, but seems like it could apply to New Orleans as well. There's a [related Facebook thread](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nolatech/permalink/692765484112313/).

> "So there appears to be a need for teachers to be able to make a wish list of items they need for their class room that is not furnished by the school board. Random people or businesses that are cleaning out old stuff or just feeling generous can locate who needs things and get them to the right teacher. While nationally available sites exist, I think this sounds small and focused enough to pull off here locally. I think I sense a hackathon coming on. Any interest?"
